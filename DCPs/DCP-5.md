## Abstract

DCP-5 is part of the fundamental framework for constructing Quest3 on-chain quest system. In order to validate if a Web3 user holds blue-chip NFTs, there is a minimum NFT holding threshold setup. And also can measure the current price of blue-chip NFTs.

## Motivation & rationales

This proposal provides reference data for the NFTs community, and a new NFTs project can provide a new channel for potential purchasers on the basis of blue-chip NFTs. The community of blue-chip NFTs can signal true partners.

## Specification

A proof-of-holding feature to tag an address currently holding NFTsâ€™ contract and symbol with the number of holdings.
